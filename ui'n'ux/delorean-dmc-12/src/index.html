            Pizzagate part 2? Bill de Blasio
            schooled on Twitter after calling
            out Domino's for selling $30 pizzas
            on New Year’s Eve
          </h2>
          <p class="news-column__info">
            New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was
            harshly panned online after accusing
            the Domino's pizza chain of “exploiting”
            New Yorkers with $30 pies on New Year’s
            Eve, with netizens giving the city
            manager a lesson in supply and demand.
          </p>
          <p class="news-column__info">
            De Blasio called out the company in a
            tweet on Wednesday, outraged about its
            New Year’s Eve prices for those celebrating
            the holiday in Times Square, and encouraging
            New Yorkers to ditch the corporate
            franchise for local eateries.
          </p>
          <p class="news-column__info">
            “Jacking up your prices on people trying
            to celebrate the holidays? Classy, Domino's,”
            he said. “To the thousands who came to
            Times Square last night to ring in 2020,
            I’m sorry this corporate chain exploited
            you – stick it to them by patronizing one
            of our fantastic LOCAL pizzerias.”

          GUINEA PIG
        </h2>
        <div class="animal-column__info">
          The guinea pig, also known as cavy, is a
          species of rodent belonging to the family
          Caviidae and the genus Cavia. Despite their
          common name, guinea pigs are not native to
          Guinea, nor are they biologically related to
          pigs, and the origin of the name is still
          unclear. They originated in the Andes of
          South America, and studies based on
          biochemistry and hybridization suggest they
          are domesticated descendants of a closely
          related species of cavy such as C. tschudii,
          and therefore do not exist naturally in the
          wild. They were originally domesticated as
          livestock, as a source of food, and continue to be.

          <p class="animal-column__fact">
            Guinea pigs are not related to pigs,
            but may have been called pigs for several
            reasons. For example, they have a similar
            squeal to a pig’s. They are also somewhat
            built like a small pig, with a large head,
            stout neck, and no real tail.

              When dropped on a very hard, rigid surface,
              glass balls and steel balls will bounce
              higher than rubber ones. The reason is
              that rubber balls deform significantly on
              impact, flattening onto the surface, and
              then springing back. In the process of this
              squashing, some energy is lost.

              The cracking sound of a whip is actually
              a sonic boom – this is because the tip of
              the whip travels faster than the speed of
              sound. The whip is the first man made
              device capable of exceeding the sound
              barrier.

              Most icebergs are salt-free water caused
              by mainland glaciers. Some sea-water
              icebergs do exist – they are green. When
              an icebergs pics up sea-water, it can
              create green stripes. Additionally, normal
              water that freezes more rapidly in the
              ‘berg can cause blue stripes. These are
              quite stunning to see and the picture below
              is a good example of this effect.
